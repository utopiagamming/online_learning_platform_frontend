### BREAKING CHANGE ⚠️

The `vue-video-player` package has now been **renamed** to [`@videojs-player/vue`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@videojs-player/vue) due to the addition of support for React. Also, support for Vue has undergone a Breaking change, with the latest version of the component **only supporting Vue3**.

The last version of the `vue-video-player` package will be released in v6.0, which will just re-export everything from `@videojs-player/vue`, so if you're ready to use the new version of `vue-video-player`, please import `@videojs-player/vue` directly.

The latest version of videojs-player supports **responsiveness** for the vast majority of Video.js configuration options and allows you to fully customize the player's control panel and interaction details, thanks to the fact that the component does enough processing internally for different frameworks.

### Legacy Version

If you are looking for a legacy version of the component for **Vue2**, use the [vue-video-player@4.x](https://github.com/surmon-china/videojs-player/tree/vue-video-player).
